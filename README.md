- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rasberry0921
Iâ€™m interested in PHP working as a Score keeper, Handicap calculator for individual pool players playing 8 ball.
Iâ€™m currently learning How to shoot pool playing in an 8 ball league.
I really see a need for a website that would do this.  It may look like a peice of cake but that frosting has hot soauce lurking within.  If interested in why I think so, contact me.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Web site which would keep score and calculate the handicap for pool players doing 8-ball. 
How to reach me ...
